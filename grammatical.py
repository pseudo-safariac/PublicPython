I am starting to write code that can be used to check if a sentence provided is grammatically correct.
Please excuse my 'notes' that I write on here...They help me gather more info on the subject since I don't have 
a computer of my own therefore, my code goes hand in hand with the notes for now (changes are upcoming later ðŸ˜Š)

"""Nouns, pronouns, Verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections.
Some words (adjectives, adverbs, interjections, nouns, verbs) are productive classes allowing new members; 
others, with functional rather than lexical meaning (articles, conjunctions, prepositions) are nonproductive 
and have a limited number of members.
Some grammarians consider articles, quantifiers, and numerals to also be parts of speech.

The subject is usually a noun â€” a word that names a person, place, or thing. 
The verb (or predicate) usually follows the subject and identifies an action or a state of being. 
An object receives the action and usually follows the verb.
